* Issues
If you get a timeout error when running this script, open "plugins/worldedit/config.yml" and change "timeout" value (should be under "Scripting") to 10000 or larger
Warn people when timeout is too small, alas context.configuration does not seem to be loaded
Need to figure out the height of the tallest legal block allowed by Minecraft given the player's location

* Potential Upcoming Improvements
Neighborhoods (4 lots to a square, houses with fenced backyards, driveway, garages
Farms (tilled and planted gardens with irrigation systems, possibly underground irrigation? how about greenhouses?)
Ponds and canals (with bridges)
Paint lines in the parking lot
Instead of basements, Parking garages under 2x2 or larger buildings
Government buildings with columns
Buildings on stilts (lots of columns around a core at first and then a normal city building on top)
Reduce the width/depth of building floors as they go up (empire state building style)
Skyscrapers (tallest building possible given the user's position)
Improved slanted roofs (using steps) with overhangs
Fancy fountians (multiple founts, rounder and scale up in larger parks)

* Ponder
Interior room generator? 

* Fixed
No random buildings in buildings
Trees in parks!
Fixed the spelling of JUSTSTEETS
Optimized transcription a bit (around 10% faster, on average) by getting before setting
Refactored the building/park resize and placement logic
Rework the building material logics (more colored cloth, less fire proof)
Doors for the buildings
Regular (and existing random) windows in buildings
Add street lines
Door and ladder fixup logic working
Place manholes for plumbing
Ladders down to reservoirs and sewers
Renamed emptylot to dirtlot
Placed manholes in parks
Arg options for emptylots, parks, parkinglots, streetsonly, towns (short) and cities (tall)
Add some lights to the reservoirs
Remove all doors and ladders for now, not really a fix more of an avoiding
Wooden floors with accent only in building's walls
Parks with underground water reservoirs 
Skylights on roofs
Support 3x3, 3x2, 2x3, 3x1, 1x3, 2x2, 2x1 and 1x2 buildings
Pyramid, needle or tented roofs for buildings
Simple park with fountain
Stairwells in basement 
Add guardrails to stairs
Thicker streets (allows for roadlines and manholes)
Need to lower the ratio of gold/diamonds in the sewer and plumbing levels
Get rid of the "make a region first" requirement
Sewer treasure encroaches onto the plumbing level
Need to narrow the sidewalks 
Add sandstone accent for wood structures 
Stairs (down into the basement, up to roof when doable) 
Streetlights 
Manholes w/ladders down to the sewer (be the "focal" point)

* Answered
How do I increase the duration of script execution? - plugins/worldedit/config.yml

* Left to player(s)
Plumbing level isn't bounded at the city edge 
Air bridges between buildings? 
Should replace outer most sidewalk with grass
