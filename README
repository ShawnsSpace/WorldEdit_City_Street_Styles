* Issues (search for !BUG!)
If you get a timeout error when running this script, open 
   "plugins/worldedit/config.yml" and change "timeout" 
   value (should be under "Scripting") to 10000 or larger
Basement doors don't "place" correctly
Manhole ladders don't "place" correctly
Need to have the height of the block based on the legal height allowed
  by Minecraft given the player's location

* Potential Upcoming Improvements
phase 1
arg options for park, town (short) and city (tall)
place manholes and steps for parks
place manholes for plumbing
add street lines
add trees to parks
remove all doors and ladders for now

phase 2
add arg options for lots
figure out doors and ladders (add them to buildings, stairs and access manholes)
add parking lots and parking spaces
add parking garage under 2x2 or larger
improve fountian (rounder and scale it up if the park is bigger, maybe)
add "government" buildings with lots of columns

phase 3
add arg option for neighborhood, ponds and canals
layout houses 4 lots to a city square
  house should centered in fenced lot
  single story with more colors
  they should have driveways and garages
reduce the width/depth of the the building floors has they get taller
regular (and existing random) windows in buildings
add parks with ponds (nearly filling them)
canals on the N, S, E or W sides (or combinations of the four)

* Ponder
Interior room generator? 
Is there a way to speed up the transcription pass?

* Fixed
Wooden floors with accent only in walls
Underground water reservoir beneath parks
Parks
Skylights on roofs
Support 3x3, 3x2, 2x3, 3x1, 1x3, 2x2, 2x1 and 1x2 buildings
Pyramid, needle or tented roofs for buildings
Simple park with fountain
Stairwells in basement 
Add guardrails to stairs
Thicker streets (allows for roadlines and manholes)
Need to lower the ratio of gold/diamonds in the sewer and plumbing levels
Get rid of the "make a region first" requirement
Sewer treasure encroaches onto the plumbing level
Need to narrow the sidewalks 
Add sandstone accent for wood structures 
Stairs (down into the basement, up to roof) 
Streetlights 
Manholes w/ladders down to the sewer (be the "focal" point)

* Answered
How do I increase the duration of script execution? - plugins/worldedit/config.yml
Should there be support for smaller blocks 2x2 instead of 3x3? - NO

* Left to player(s)
Plumbing level isn't bounded at the city edge 
Air bridges between buildings? 
Should replace outer most sidewalk with grass
